# substitute() = non-standard evaluation possible
# return an expression (return whatever input)
# paired with deparse() - turns expressions into characters
# quote() - similar to substitute() but return always its argument only (not interactive with inputs)
# eval()

# as.name() converts a string to a name = as.symbole (is.name(), is.symbol())
# quote() captures names. 
# paired with parse(text = "")
